## Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for a Neural Network Model

Data preprocessing involves transforming raw data to well-formed data sets so that data mining analytics can be applied. Raw data is often incomplete and has inconsistent formatting. The adequacy or inadequacy of data preparation has a direct correlation with the success of any project that involve data analyics.

Preprocessing involves both data validation and data imputation. The goal of data validation is to assess whether the data in question is both complete and accurate. The goal of data imputation is to correct errors and input missing values -- either manually or automatically through business process automation (BPA) programming.

Data preprocessing is used in both database-driven and rules-based applications. In machine learning (ML) processes, data preprocessing is critical for ensuring large datasets are formatted in such a way that the data they contain can be interpreted and parsed by learning algorithms.

## For Deliverable 3: Optimize your Model
At least 3 attempts if you can't get results over 75%
Noisy variables are removed from features (2.5 pt)
Additional neurons are added to hidden layers (2.5 pt)
Additional hidden layers are added (5 pt)
The activation function of hidden layers or output layers is changed for optimization (5 pt)
The model's weights are saved every 5 epochs (2.5 pt)
The results are saved to an HDF5 file (2.5 pt)

## For Deliverable 4: Results and Summary
### Results: 

* Data Preprocessing
  * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
